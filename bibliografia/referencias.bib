  Contracts indeed do characteristically arise through an exchange of
  promises. This is inscribed in legal doctrine, in the principles that
  contracts are created through
  1) offer, 2) acceptance, and 3) consideration.}}

   In a smart contract, the declaration of intent is given through a transaction to the contract itself. In the 
   example, Adeline created the contract but Bob also made a transaction from his account to the contract. 

   = The declaration of intent is not separate from the formation of the contract or from the execution of it.
