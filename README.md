# Ley Algomata (Lex Algomata)
=============================

Some people call it **Algorithmic Governance**. I prefer to call it **Lex Algomata** or (**Ley Algomatica**) because this term highlights two distinctive features of this emerging technology, namely, automation and risk, as explained in 1 and 2, below. 

In brief, the Lex Algomata, is expected to automate most of the judicial 
procedures that are currently executed by humans (lawyers) to enforce 
the law.

1. Ley algomata: in my serious and direct definition _algo_ stands 
   for **algorithm** 
   and _mata_ stands for **automa**. This suggest the use of
   Automata Theory to model algorithms that will help authorities
   (normally represented by lawyers) to enforce the law automatically.
  
 
 2. Ley algomata:  in my more serious and worringly definition, **algo** stands 
    for **something** and **mata** stands for **kill** (all in Spanish 
    language).  It tries to raise concerns that careless automation of law 
    can cause serious problems including death. Let us not forget that
    Computer Technology is not free from failures.  
    
The idea behinhs the first point is illustrated by the 
Finite State Automata of shown in the folloging figure:

The idea behind the second point is illustrated by the following
